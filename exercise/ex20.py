'''

usernames = ["john 1990", "alberta1970", "magnola2000"]

Extend the code above so the code prints out a list containing
the number of characters for each username.

The output of your code should be as below:

[9, 11, 11]

'''

usernames = ["john 1990", "alberta1970", "magnola2000"]

chars = [len(i) for i in usernames]
print(chars)
