Supposedly, the following program should:

1. Prompt the user to input an index (e.g., 0, 1, or 2).

2. Print out the item with that index.

However, there is a bug with the program which you should try to fix.



menu = ["pasta", "pizza", "salad"]

user_choice = input("Enter the index of the item: ")

message = f"You chose {menu[user_choice]}."
print(message)

menu = ["pasta", "pizza", "salad"]

user_choice = int(input("Enter the index of the item: "))

message = f"You chose {menu[user_choice]}."
print(message)
