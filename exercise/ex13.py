'''

ips = ['100.122.133.105', '100.122.133.111']

Copy-paste the ips list in a .py file and extend the program so it:

1. Prompts the user to input an index (e.g, 0 or 1).

2. Returns the IP address that has that index.

Here is how the program would behave when executed:
'''

ips = ['100.122.133.105', '100.122.133.111']

prompt = int(input("Enter the index of the IP you want: "))
message = f"You chose {ips[prompt]}"
print(message)
