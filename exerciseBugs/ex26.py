Alina has created a speed calculation function. She traveled a total
of 200 miles today which took her two hours. She wants to use her function to calculate the average speed.

def speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time

print(speed([200, 4]))
However, when she calls the function (as you see below), she gets an error:

TypeError: speed() missing 1 required positional argument: 'time'

Try fixing the code so she gets 50 as output.

def speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time


print(speed(200, 4))
