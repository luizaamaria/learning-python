In the previous exercise, we hardcoded the values 0 and 100. However,
it is better to place those values in constants. Therefore, your task is to:

1. create a FREEZING_POINT and a BOILING_POINT variable and store
 the values 0 and 100 in them respectively.

2. modify the function of the previous exercise by using those variables
 instead of the hardcoded 0 and 100 values. The previous function is given in the code area.

'''

FREEZING_POINT = 0
BOILING_POINT = 100


# Define a function named water_state that takes one parameter: temperature
def water_state(temperature):
    # Check if the temperature is less than or equal to the freezing point
    if temperature <= FREEZING_POINT:
        return "Solid"
        # Check if the temperature is between the freezing point and boiling point
    elif FREEZING_POINT < temperature < BOILING_POINT:
        return "Liquid"
        # Return "Gas" for all other cases
    else:
        return "Gas"
